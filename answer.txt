1. Why are tou interested in Data Science?
I'm a statistics major student, and I've took several courses about data mining and other statistical packages.
Though the datamining class I took gave me a breif glimpse about it, I felt it's a really interesting part to study.
Therefore I registered this course to learn further on data science.

2. What is Data science?
In my opinion, data science is a kind of scientific approach to data.
For example, people can handle unarranged, accumulated data by their own with lots of scientific(like digital) tools.
And then people can make their own decisions from it. I think it is data science.

3. Experience?
As I said, I'm a statistics major, so I dealt with several data analysis projects.
In those analysis projects, I handled software tools such as R, SAS etc., but really basic codings.
